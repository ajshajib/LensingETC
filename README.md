# Lensing Exposure Time Calculator

The `LensingETC` tool allows to optimize observing strategies for multi-filter 
imaging campaigns of galaxy-scale strong lensing systems. See Shajib et al.
(2022) for a description of the tool. See the notebook [Lensing Exposure 
Time Calculator.ipynb](https://github.com/ajshajib/LensingETC/blob/main/Lensing%20exposure%20time%20calculator.ipynb) for an example of how to setup and run the tool.

`LensingETC` is built on top of `lenstronomy`([GitHub repo](https://github.com/sibirrer/lenstronomy)), 
a lens modelling software program affiliated 
with Astropy. See [here](https://github.com/sibirrer/lenstronomy/blob/main/AUTHORS.rst) 
for a full list of contributors to `lenstronomy`.
